An `nvmrc` file is included if using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:
Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. 
In order to start the server, type in `npm start` on the command line. Then, type in `npm run dev:react` to set up the compiler and then `npm run db:setup` to seed from the sql database. Additionally, there are tests that have been writting which can be seen through 'npm test'.
